# Assignment Details  
These are the details provided in the task sheet for this assignment.

## Background
Educational games are immersive and use the full screen. For example, there are apps designed for very young children to help improve hand-eye coordination. There are apps that help kids explore various levels of reading, writing, maths, and science. Recently, apps that introduce children to programming have become popular.

## Task
The task is to design an educational game for **high school kids** that helps them with some aspect of **schoolwork**. You can assume that high school kids understand how to use GUI interfaces and they expect to be fast with engaging graphics, animations, and sounds.

The GUI design for your app should be **intuitive**, **clear**, **responsive**, and **visually interesting**. Moreover, high school kids are introduced to a variety of analytical thinking skills and problem-solving skills at school for which traditional teaching styles have become less effective for the modern generations. Therefore, your educational game should include **puzzles** that rely on some combination of **memory**, **pattern recognition** and **promote patience**.

Your game is expected to have **four screens: 1) landing page, 2) game screen, 3) settings screen, and 4) high scores screen**. Additionally, your game should include some basic use of **database programming**, **sensor programming** and **social network integration**. You are expected to include some **non-GUI unit testing** that demonstrates the **stability of your model code** in some useful ways.

## Rubric
### General code quality:
* The source code is very well constructed having effective code formatting, readability, and naming conventions
* Code comments are descriptive, useful and clear

### Android XML usage:
* Your app shows very effective use of GUI XML and configuration XML in activities and other components, app restrictions and app permissions
* There are no XML warnings

### App purpose:
* Your app has excellent education potential such as making learning is fun, being well organised, and providing progressive objectives

### General code design:
* All aspects of code design are excellent such as MVCs, Utilities / Facades, DAOs, and lifecycle callbacks

### Unit testing:
* The project work makes excellent use of unit testing that verifies code stability and correctness in some useful ways

### Social network integration:
* Your app provides social networking in a creatively way to promote and popularize the app

### SQL coding:
* Your app maintains high scores using an appropriate SQLite database via associated Android SQL APIs

### Sensor coding:
* Your app makes use of various Sensor APIs (e.g. shake gesture, long press, orientation, accelerator, ...) in interesting ways
