This repo is for my CP3402 Assignment 2

See the Assignment Details [here](/assignment_details.md). 

I ran out of time to implement to the following:

- Add SQlite database.
- Make child classes of the Round class, to clean up the code and make it more readable.
- General "de-spaghetiify" the rest of the codebase.
- Add sound effects and music.
- Create a more "game-like" feel.

Perhaps I will come back to this in the future to add these things as development practice.
